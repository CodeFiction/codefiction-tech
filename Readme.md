## Building the code
This repository is built using [Angular](angular.io). There are two ways to build and test this application

### Building using Docker
Why would you install stupid stuff to your shiny laptop while you can Dockerize it? Exactly!

```sh
docker-compose up serve
docker-compose up lint
docker-compose up test
```

### Building using local Node
If you are one of those old fashioned guys you can still build the code using the following `npm` commands

```sh
npm install
npm test
npm run start:dev
npm run lint
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`
